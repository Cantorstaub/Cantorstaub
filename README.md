## Programming as Media Archaeology

Being a media studies scholar, I use programming as an epistemic tool within an academic context.

Albeit sympathetic towards Digital Humanities, I am only secondarily interested in how digital software and its output can be used as alternative research methods or create novel results for the digitized Humanities. Building upon approaches from Media-Archaeology, my focus lies on the software and algorithms and their implications “themselves,” on contemporary and historical forms of computation, their functionalities and limitations, examining the question of how – and if – hands-on programming can serve as a means to extend and complement discursive analysis within media theory and history.

The language I use and teach the most is Python. The way I use the language is informed by experiences with programming in machine language and assembler, especially with the Signetics 2650. As my programming is scientifically oriented, my coding prioritizes accessibility over elegance and clarity over efficiency. In some cases, it will even include what Pythonistas call an anti-pattern: code that, albeit functional, does not obey the established rules of how to do things correctly in Python when programming for third parties. This specific way of programming is informed by the intention to grasp aspects of epistemological relevance from a particular piece of code (if there are) and to use it to consolidate, correct, and expand existing media theoretical knowledge on computation and digital artifacts and their epistemic ramifications.

This is expanded by work with the Arduino microcontroller and corresponding projects in physical computation and robotics. Especially while being in charge of the technical side of things in the Virtual Humanities Lab at Ruhr-University Bochum, it included building and testing the Lidar on Wheels Robot, a small experimental transportation device for the measuring of rooms with the RPLidar A1M8 Sensor.

In my seminal teaching, I combine hands-on introductions to programming in Python (and also Arduino) with discursive analyses of texts on digital phenomena. The goal is to enable Humanities students to grasp basic yet central functionalities of digital media and to understand the possibilities of combining these practical engagements with critical reading and thinking about digital phenomena across persisting disciplinary delimitations.
